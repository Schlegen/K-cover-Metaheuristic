Iteration log . . .
Iteration:     1   Dual infeasibility =             0.000000
Iteration:     2   Dual objective     =             2.000000

Dual crossover.
  Dual:  Fixing 2 variables.
        1 DMoves:  Infeasibility  0.00000000e+00  Objective  2.00000000e+00
        0 DMoves:  Infeasibility  0.00000000e+00  Objective  2.00000000e+00
  Dual:  Pushed 0, exchanged 2.
  Primal:  Fixed no variables.

Dual simplex - Optimal:  Objective =  2.0000000000e+00
Solution time =    0.00 sec.  Iterations = 2 (1)
Deterministic time = 0.08 ticks  (75.63 ticks/sec)
